# 2020 Investing Strategy & Principles
2020 has been a monumental year for me as an investor. Before 2020 I was buying and selling stocks blindly. Not having an investing strategy and taking profits any and every chance I could get. I was doing "ok" but knew I could do better, but how?

I first started with wanting to understand the technicals. I saw the candlesticks for stock charts but didn't know what the purpose of these candlesticks was or how to use them. So, I started with building a python bot to kill two birds with one stone. The first bird was named python and I wanted to get better a developing and a deeper understanding of the language. The second bird 2 was named Investing and this was the bigger of the two and I'm not even sure if I killed this bird. Either way, I'm looking to get better at investing and using this skill to increase my wealth and eventually leave my job.

Which brings me to now. Now I'm on this investing kick to soak up as much information as possible when it comes to all things investing. Over the past 6 months I've done a significant amount of reading and listening to investors speak about "investing Do's and Don'ts", how they invest, and other strategies. And now I'm actively deploying and tweaking my own investing strategy and principals.

Below is my current investing strategy and principles. Overall, my strategy is to buy and hold for the long term. 

#### Use Time
I've recently learned that waiting is the best strategy but also the hardest. As of recent, I'm starting to see that most successful investors use this tool called time. 

#### Dollar Cost Averaging - DCA
Learning about using the DCA strategy has improved my mindset to further spread out my capital overtime and not enter a position all at once. Because I'm using the DCA strategy I'll be able to purchase stocks without having to "wait for the dip".

# When To Sell

When Should You Sell a Stock?
#### Better opportunities

Sometimes, there's nothing wrong at all with a company or its stock; there are simply better opportunities elsewhere. We'll consider selling a less attractive stock (even at a loss!) if we think another investment has stronger prospects.

#### Business changes

A new competitive threat emerges or competitors perform better than expected.

#### Valuation

We're all for the long term here, but sometimes, Mr. Market shows our stock too much love. We'll consider selling if a stock's price has run up to a point where it no longer reflects the underlying value of the business.

#### Faulty investment thesis

 You should seriously consider selling if it turns out your rationale for buying a stock was flawed, if your valuation was too optimistic, or if you underestimated the risks.

#### It keeps us up at night

 Stick with what keeps you comfortable.
