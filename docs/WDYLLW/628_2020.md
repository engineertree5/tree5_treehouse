## Candlesticks w/ Yahoo,Matplotlib,Pandas
Before I jump off into the deepend of what I learned about candlesticks. I'm going to give you a general idea of how candlesticks are used and the different types of candlesticks you will see in a chart. 

What are candlesticks? 
Candlesticks are a representation of a stocks **Open High Low and Close** price for a given period (month, day, hour etc). Depending on the type of day the stock had the candle size will reflect that. Before we go any further, lets get some basic terminology down so we are all speaking the same language. . 

Real Body

The real body is almost self explainitory. The real body is the wide part of the candlestick body. The body is usually filled in with a shade of green or red. The color (green or red) lets you know if the stock closing price was Higher or Lower than the stock opening.
