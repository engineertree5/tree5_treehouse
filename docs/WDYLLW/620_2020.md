## Creating Dictionaries + Adding key,values
<center>
<b>THE PROBLEM</b>
</center>

I was looking to improve my current tweet format. I was able to pull out the stock symbol from the `yfinance` api but to be more explicit as to what company I'm analyzing, lets add the company name. To do this I knew the best way was to create a dict.

The first thing you will ALWAYS need to do when you are looking to store objects in a list or dict is initialize the dict if you do not already have one. 

```python
pick_info = {}
pick_info['symbols'] = {}

##### 
REPL OUTPUT: {'symbols': {}}
```
I took the time to doodle my dict on some paper so I knew it was going to be a nested dict. This way `symbols` is the parent and the stock symbols + names are the children. now to add the children to this dict

```python
watchlist = ['MSFT', 'V', 'DLR', 'CONE']
for stock_pick in stock_list:
    company_symbol = yf.Ticker(f'{stock_pick}')
    data = company_symbol.history(period=f"{days}d")
    try:
        s_name = company_symbol.get_info()['shortName']
    except IndexError as err:
        s_name = '*'
        print(err)
    pick_info['symbols'][stock_pick] = s_name

```
<b>ErrorHandling</b> 

I needed error handling due to the fact that all stock api's are not made equal. the `get_info()['shortName']` method would throw an `IndexError` each time I would make a call against a stock where the attribute `shortName` was not available. So, putting the method call into a try except block would let my program still run if/when a stock shortName is not available.

After the try catch block is where we are updating the dict `pick_info['symbols'][stock_pick] = s_name` This is how you update a dict. We did this after we first initialized by adding `symbols`. Now we are dynamically creating a list each time the for-loop is executed. If our list of stock grows so will our dict without having to make updates.
