# 2020 Investing Strategy & Principles
2020 has been a monumental year for me as an investor. Before 2020 I was buying and selling stocks blindly. Not having an investing strategy and taking profits any and every chance I could get. I was doing "ok" but knew I could do better, but how?

I first started with wanting to understand the technicals. I saw the candlesticks for stock charts but didn't know what the purpose of these candlesticks was or how to use them. So, I started with building a python bot to kill two birds with one stone. The first bird was named python and I wanted to get better a developing and a deeper understanding of the language. The second bird 2 was named Investing and this was the bigger of the two and I'm not even sure if I killed this bird. Either way, I'm looking to get better at investing and using this skill to increase my wealth and eventually leave my job.

Which brings me to now. Now I'm on this investing kick to soak up as much information as possible when it comes to all things investing. Over the past 6 months, I've done a significant amount of reading and listening to investors speak about "investing Do's and Don'ts", how they invest, and other strategies. And now I'm actively deploying and tweaking my own investing strategy and principals.

Below is my current investing strategy and principles. Overall, my strategy is to buy and hold quality companies for the long term. Adding to my winners, using DCA to add to my positions over time, and sticking to my strategy. 

#### Use Time
I've recently learned that waiting and being patient is the best strategy for investors but also the hardest. When looking back from when I first started investing until recently, boy! If I had held *most of my positions I would be a richer man today. And that is ok with me. The learning process is just like investing, it will take time.

#### Dollar Cost Averaging - DCA
Learning about using the DCA strategy has improved my mindset to further spread out my capital overtime and not enter a position all at once. Because I'm using the DCA strategy I'll be able to purchase stocks without having to "wait for the dip". 

#### Stick To Your Trade
I work as a software engineer and I'm pretty 

#### DO NOT PANIC SELL
The last thing you want to do is have weak hands and sell off your shares with the rest of the market. Yes, I've been apart of panic sell crowd and let my emotions get the best of me. After diving deeper into investing and getting a better understanding of the cyclical nature of the market. This and among other stats gave me a better understanding of why panic selling should be avoided.

#### Cover Your Back First 
When investing, you should assume that at any point you can lose 100% of your investment. This is why you should never invest money that you depend on. Make sure that you have enough money stashed away in your `emergency fund` for 3-6 months. Give yourself enough leeway so your finances wont be on a rollercoaster if an unexpected headwind comes your way. 

My own strategy is to have enough money for a year to cover all expense as if my lifestyle never changed. Once I met this goal I started adding what was going to go into my emergency fund into my investing account. 

# Stock Buying / Research Guide
I use the below criteria when researching stocks to understand the company risk level of my investment. The list by no means is perfect and will probably change overtime.   

#### Strong Leadership
Long-term focus on the growth and vision of the company. When looking to invest money into a company it is important for me to find a CEO or management team with a strong focus on the future.

#### Cash on hand
When I'm looking into a company and the finances behind the business. There needs to be enough cash on hand to cover the debt taken out by the company. Meaning, if the company is overloaded with debt and they do not have enough cash to cover said debt. I'm going to take a deep look at the debt, it may be new debt with a low interest rate or it may be high interest debt that is owed back to the borrower soon. Certainly want to steer clear of companies that do not have a clear path to profitability or have too much debt that cannot be covered by cash on hand.

# Finviz filters

I've been using [Finviz](https://finviz.com/) to filter and search for high quality stocks that fit my investing profile, which is growth! The below are setting I use to find high stocks that have high growth potiential. 

First, I got to the screener tab to get started. 

<center> <b>Valuation Tab</b> </center>

`Sector` - I work with in the tech space so I start by looking at companies that I can relate to or that I can quickly familiarize myself with. so for the sector I select `Technology`

`Industry` - Same as what was mention in the `Sector` section, I work in tech.

`Country` - USA. I'm sticking with the United States until I get a better understanding of risk with international investing. 

[Switching to the fundamental tab...]

`Forward P/E` - Looking at the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and making sure the company is profitable in the coming quarters. this filter is set to let me know the company is already making money and **SHOULD** continue to do so.

`EPS Growth This Year` - looking for a positive Earning Per Share (EPS) does not gurantee that I'm filtering out a profitable company. Just like when looking at the technical analysis of a chart. It will take many variables to deem your point of view valid before seeing the valid buy point.

`Sales growth qtr over qtr` - Along with looking for EPS growth this year, I'm looking for
