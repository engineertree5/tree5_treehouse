# 2021 Prep and review - Investing

If I were to review my 2020 investing journey and identify what made 2020 investing so successful. I would say luck had a lot to do with my gains. I'd also say getting in the game and understanding the rules had a lot to do with my gains as well. There were other factors which helped me become the best investor i've been since starting the investing journey. Let me review what I think helped me be a better investor in 2020 and beyond

**Paying for a service** - This was the catalyst that propelled me to the next level. I started a Motley Fool subscription sometime in June 2020. The information that I found within that service is truly life changing. Information that I wish I had acquired earlier. There was mounds of information within the site that was overwhelming for a new investor like myself. Which I feel every new investor should take the time and invest in a service like Motley Fool. A service that is sharing stock picks along with providing educational material. 

**Reading** - Crazy as this sounds but reading about investing can position you to be a better investor. In the past I was getting trading and investing mixed up. My style aligns more with the investor side. However, If I were to be a trader I would be a swing trader. Making trades that span a few weeks to months, not days. 

The best book that I read in 2020 was "How to Make Money in Stocks" by William O'Neil. This book was such an eye opener. So much to unpack from reading this book and will more than likely be reading it once a year.

**Research** - I don't think I've spent as much time doing research on a subject since picking up photography. I really enjoyed the research phase. There was and is so much to know about companies and the innovators behind them. Profits a company makes, or not. What their road map looks like for the future. Everything is public information that you can research.

# 2021 Investing Strategy & Principles

#### Stick to Your Investments
DO NOT CHASE! Stick to your core investing thesis. There are 5K+ publicly traded companies. You do not have the time or resources to jump from company to company. Define your portfolio and live by that definition. 

#### DO NOT PANIC SELL

The last thing you want to do is have weak hands and sell off your shares with the rest of the market. March 2020 got the best of me and exposed my weak hands. After going back and reviewing the stock markets performance over time. I noticed that the market has continued to climb up and to the right. There are dips here and there but the market recovers. If I have money in positions that are over valued, stretched or my conviction is low, the next drop will expose that.

#### IF you do sell...
If you do need to sell a stock have a valid reason and flesh out why you are selling said stock. Is it to chase another stock? Better opportunity? write it down and revisit the "why" 3-6 months from the time you sold. 

#### Sit Tight
Sit tight and stick to your plan and core holdings.

#### Write and log research
I'd like to start taking the time to write out research 

# Stocks on Chopping Block (2021)

Although these stocks are on the chopping block I DO NOT think I'm going to sell them any time soon. These are stocks that I would sell IF I need capital for another investment.  Identifying the stocks to put on the chopping block was hard enough. To sell a winner (most of them are) is not an easy decision to make. Either way, I have these stocks on a chopping block to make room for other positions. At the time of writing this - 12/26/2020 - the market is red host and a lot of companies are trading at fairly high valuations. 

`$RDFN / $EXPI` - I have a total of 3 real estate plays and for me that is 2 too many. I'd like to be able to know which one of the companies `$EXPI` `$RDFN` `$Z`... As I was typing this I've come to realize that the real estate market is a Trillion dollar market. The real competition in this space are the dinosaurs guarding it. 

`$HUB` - Let the leaders lead. `$CRM` Has this space on lock and I'm not looking to see
