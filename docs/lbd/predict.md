# Predictions

# $JMIA
I noticed a nice little cup with handle for Jumia while I was running some TA on stocks that I own. I notice a textbook cup being formed within the Jumia graph and said to myself "this is exactly what Bill O'neil describes in his book!". I also notice a huge spike in volume as well. I'm going to continue to watch this stock and update my technical analysis as I continue to own this company.

# $RDVT

Red Violet is a company came on my radar while I was in the darkroom developing film and listening to Motley Fool podcast. The company business model is quite interesting, yet controversial, so I decided to invest. After learning some basic TA analysis the below is my prediction for Red Violet. I'll be revisiting this come Feb '21

# $HUBS

This was a motley fool recommendation over the summer that I ignored due to just joining the service. Didn't want to "blindly" follow a service that I just joined. I wanted to see if they were as good as advertisted... YUP! they sure were. Since tracking the stock its gone up and to the right. I added this to my portfolio a bit late but now its making it's way to the top of my conviction list. Anyway, I see this company continuing to climb and ride this channel until the bulls come home.
