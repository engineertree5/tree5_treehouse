# 100 Baggers by Christopher Mayer - 03/13/2021

## Why buy/read the book? - Chapters 1-3

> This book is about 100-baggers. These are stocks that return $100 for every $1 invested. that means a $10,00 investment turns into $1,000,000.

The real reason I purchased this book, 100 baggers, was to gain insight into how I can make the most out of my investing career. I feel like a late bloomer so why not aim for the fences with a 100 bagger? As of writing this, I'm 4 chapters deep and I'm enjoying most of what I've read so far. The tricky thing about knowledge is that your brain process it differently every go around. Sometimes it is not even registered as knowledged. Anyway, I can tell that my brain is enjoying the information Christopher Mayer has written in the first few chapters.

> Investors crave activity, and Wall Street is built on it. The media feeds it all, making it seem as if important things happen every day. hundreds of millions of shares change hands every session. -Thomas Phelps 

The first few pages of this book are filled with facts and quotes from Thomas Phelps - The originator of the 100-bagger study. You could also say common sense but it's not common until you read it and say to yourself "oh, right". Like here, what Phelps says `The key is not only finding them but keeping them. buy right and hold on`. It's quotes like this that propel you through the chapter looking and yearning for more quotes and information. Here is a breakdown of what I took away from the first chapter. 

* When you find a business you like, focus on the business, not the stock price. Look at the `earnings per share` and `return on equity
* You will need to grit your teeth and hold on. Holding on to a winner is never an easy feat.
  * Same time, do not buy and walk away. You will need to keep an eye on the business and how it performs over the long-term. 
* Understand how a company can create value years ahead. profit margins, growth trends, and price-earnings ratios are nice but focus on what WILL be next for the company.

> One can argue every sale is a confession of error, and the shorter the time you've held the stock, the greater the error in buying it. -Thomas Phelps

Chapter 2 focused on success stories from investors who were able to buy right and sit tight. Buying and holding a stock sounds simple until you try it. The stories that were discussed highlighted the hard part of holding but also the rewarding. But the stories were more so reflections, so I chalk 'em all as hindsight being 20/20. Everything looks good when you talk about the past. 

> know what you own and then really own it, as you would a rental property. Then go about your life without all the baggage and worry that comes from sweating over the data-today or month-to-month to month value of your portfolio. 

Chapter 3 sparked more excitement for me than chapter 2. 3 covered the different kinds of coffee-can portfolios and a few 100-bagger use-cases. The coffee-can portfolio is an investing strategy where you place stock(s) in a "coffee-can" and don't touch it for an extended period. The idea here is to protect you against yourself -- from the emotions and volatility that make you buy or sell at the wrong times. A few examples of successful coffee-can portfolios followed. An example that I found interesting was of a successful mutual fund, MIT, that held had an average holding period of 27 years! MIT also went on to outperform the stock market. Buy right and sit tight, right? Over time, your best bet is to bet on the overall stock market. The book goes to point out 

> You must pick a compelling story and you must use money you can afford to lose because you must be willing to risk it all. ALL OF IT.
