# Next Focus (4 Qtrs)
- [ ] HealthCare - Really need to build the base of my technical and development chops
- [ ] Health - I perform better when I feel better. Going to test out fasting for the month of december and check back in in January. I will also not be drinking liquor by will be rewarding myself with wine from time to time. 

- [ ] Lock in Portfolio for 2021. I'm still making changes and will NEED to stop adding positions. I need to add a rule for adding a new position before adding to an existing or selling a current position.

## Personalis $PSNL

?> WIP - Currently researching PSNL technology https://www.personalis.com/technology/

Personalis is a leader in advanced genomics for cancer. Personalis provides advanced genomic sequencing and analytic solutions. 

> Immuno-oncology (immune system + the study of cancer) - the study and development of treaments that take advantage of the body's immune system. 

> biopsy - examination of tissue removed from a living body to discover the presence, cause or extent of a disease. 

### Growth Oppourtunties 

<center> <h3>NeXT Platform</h3> </center>

* Patented ACE (Accuracy and Content Enhanced) Technology is the foundation of the PersonalisÂ® NeXT Platform. ACE improves processes from nucleic acid preparation, to sequencing, to analytics for superior sequencing results.

> Liquid biopsies are tests that allow physicians to look for cancer cells from tumors in samples of blood from patients. They provide several advantages over tissue biopsies, including helping detect cancer faster and improving health outcomes.

1. Arrival: The moment samples arrive at our CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified laboratory, the samples are given a unique sample ID and are tracked in LIMS and Symphony.

1. Sample sparing preparation: Our laboratory staff bring a wealth of operational expertise, allowing us to hone our sample sparing methods.

1. Quality Review: Prior to sequencing, samples undergo robust QC assessment.Sequencing: The NeXT assays run simultaneously to streamline processes and save time.

1. Analysis: Sequencing data is then run through our framework of analytical pipelines and tools to provide a wealth of precision oncology-related biomarker information for each individual patient sample

1. FAS Support: Every aspect of every project is overseen and managed by a designated PhD-level Project Manager. In addition, upon data delivery, your dedicated Field Applications Scientist will walk through the comprehensive dataset, and is available to answer any technical or commercial questions, and to follow-up with our internal scientific teams as needed.

<center> <h3>Partnership With MapKure </h3></center>

MapKure is looking to partner with Personalis to utilize the NeXT Platform - which enables broad tumor immunogenoic profiling of the tumor and consolidates multiple biomarker assays into one, providing a multidimensional view of the tumor and its tumor microenvironment from a single sample, which will help MapKure understand if other biomarkers are clinically relevant. 

> "Our NeXT Platform provides biotechnology companies, like MapKure, with comprehensive genomic information from the entire exome and transcriptome, and provides information that can support the identification of new, advanced biomarkers. Once these biomarkers have been selected by MapKure, we expect to develop them as a companion diagnostic for regulatory submission and approval. We look forward to working with MapKure to accelerate the development of their cancer therapy in the clinic by utilizing the results from our NeXT Platform." - John West, CEO at Personalis
