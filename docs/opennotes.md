## SSH PI

I was listening to an episode of [The Real Python podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/) and there was a brief conversation about remote development on a raspberry pi. This is what got me thinking about improving my current workflow I'm making updates to my stock bot. I'm running my pi headless and whenever I want to run test or make updates I find myself dropping into `vim`. Nothing wrong with using `vim` but it can be slow and cumbersome when you are looking to make swift changes and updates. So, what to do? 

**[REMOTE DEVELOPMENT WITH VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)**. Yup! If you have yet to try remote dev with vs code, I highly recommend you give it a try. All you is needed is two computers and root level access on both. From there you can modify and make updates where necessary.

I used this [link](https://medium.com/@pythonpow/remote-development-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-ssh-and-vscode-a23388e24bc7) to setup my environments and seamlessly remote into my raspberry

## Private Key Cryptography - PKC

Sooooo PKC is the shit! You get TWO EXTREMELY LONG prime numbers - these are going to be your private keys - and combine them. Those combined prime numbers will be your public key. So, now you can assign that prime number to a txt message. Then send it out into the wild, across the internet, into your receivers hands safely. Ah! But keep in mind that in order to read (decrypt) the txt message you need th other large prime number to read it. If another person try’s to read your message they will need the other large prime number (private key) to decrypt the message.... fuckin’ PKC. Cool shit

## Digging through a 10-K

I went ahead and decided to take my investing knowledge to the next level and start looking at company `10-K's`. I believe once you've reached this level of research, there is no turning back. So, going forward it is about to get nerdy.

Why look into this document called a `10-K`? Well, I'm looking to be a better investor, right? The 10-K and 10-Q offer up important company financials that can show the growth potential of a company and its underlying business segments  - changes in management, areas of concern and competition, current operations, and future plans. It can also do the inverse, show you potential risk and dips in revenue.

As I familiarize myself with the format of `10-K` documents it will be easier to perform deep dives on companies that interest me and my dump truck of cash.

I'm going to take a look at a company most of us are familiar with, Microsoft. The quickest way to get to the `10-K` or `10-Q` is to go to the [SEC EDGAR Database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

## Why Buy $RCM ?

First how did I even find `$RCM`? I started with finviz.com and used their free stock screener. Next, I started to filter down companies that showed 20% growth year over year for their earnings per share `EPS` and positive sales growth. The below is an example of what I used. 

Moving on over to the chart. Because I'm learning a little bit about technical analysis I wanted to see what the charts were telling me.

1. `$RCM` is moving about its 20d MA, 50d MA, and 200d MA.

1. The Relative Strength is showing strong positioning. I also just noticed earning is tomorrow Nov 2nd! Lets wait to see how their earning is reported. 

1. Volume appears to be drying up right before earnings. If their earning are good I will certainly be adding a position.

Looks like `$RCM`is/could have a breakout if earnings goes as planned. I'm not 100% sure about the breakout statement as I'm in the current process of getting better with identifying bases and knowing where support & resistance stands.

So is this a real reason to buy? ... I'm going to go out on a limb here and say yes. However, I'm not really sure what this company's core business is and i'm looking to get a better understanding before Nov 2nd.
