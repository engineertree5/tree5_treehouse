## SSH PI

I was listening to an episode of [The Real Python podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/) and there was a brief conversation about remote development on a raspberry pi. This is what got me thinking about improving my current workflow I'm making updates to my stock bot. I'm running my pi headless and whenever I want to run test or make updates I find myself dropping into `vim`. Nothing wrong with using `vim` but it can be slow and cumbersome when you are looking to make swift changes and updates. So, what to do? 

**[REMOTE DEVELOPMENT WITH VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)**. Yup! If you have yet to try remote dev with vs code, I highly recommend you give it a try. All you is needed is two computers and root level access on both. From there you can modify and make updates where necessary.

I used this [link](https://medium.com/@pythonpow/remote-development-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-ssh-and-vscode-a23388e24bc7) to setup my environments and seamlessly remote into my raspberry

## Private Key Cryptography - PKC

Sooooo PKC is the shit! You get TWO EXTREMELY LONG prime numbers - these are going to be your private keys - and combine them. Those combined prime numbers will be your public key. So, now you can assign that prime number to a txt message. Then send it out into the wild, across the internet, into your receivers hands safely. Ah! But keep in mind that in order to read (decrypt) the txt message you need th other large prime number to read it. If another person try’s to read your message they will need the other large prime number (private key) to decrypt the message.... fuckin’ PKC. Cool shit

## Digging through a 10-K

I went ahead and decided to take my investing knowledge to the next level and start looking at company `10-K's`. I believe once you've reached this level of research, there is no turning back. So, going forward it is about to get nerdy.

Why look into this document called a `10-K`? Well, I'm looking to be a better investor, right? The 10-K and 10-Q offer up important company financials that can show the growth potential of a company and its underlying business segments  - changes in management, areas of concern and competition, current operations, and future plans. It can also do the inverse, show you potential risk and dips in revenue.

As I familiarize myself with the format of `10-K` documents it will be easier to perform deep dives on companies that interest me and my dump truck of cash.

I'm going to take a look at a company most of us are familiar with, Microsoft. The quickest way to get to the `10-K` or `10-Q` is to go to the [SEC EDGAR Database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

### What I Find Important Within A 10-Q 

Income Statement - 

Balance Sheet - Financial statement that reports a company's `assets`, `liabilities`, and `shareholders equity` at a specific point in time. It is a fianancial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, as well as amount invested by share holders. 

Cash Flow Statement -

## Why Buy $RCM ?

First how did I even find `$RCM`? I started with finviz.com and used their free stock screener. Next, I started to filter down companies that showed 20% growth year over year for their earnings per share `EPS` and positive sales growth. The below is an example of what I used. 

Moving on over to the chart. Because I'm learning a little bit about technical analysis I wanted to see what the charts were telling me.

1. `$RCM` is moving about its 20d MA, 50d MA, and 200d MA.

1. The Relative Strength is showing strong positioning. I also just noticed earning is tomorrow Nov 2nd! Lets wait to see how their earning is reported. 

1. Volume appears to be drying up right before earnings. If their earning are good I will certainly be adding a position.

Looks like `$RCM`is/could have a breakout if earnings goes as planned. I'm not 100% sure about the breakout statement as I'm in the current process of getting better with identifying bases and knowing where support & resistance stands.

So is this a real reason to buy? ... I'm going to go out on a limb here and say yes. However, I'm not really sure what this company's core business is and i'm looking to get a better understanding before Nov 2nd.

### RCM Update 11/15/2020
`$RCM` actually held up pretty well which is kind of surprising. I honestly do not know what I'm doing. I just know i'm trying to get better and one way to do that is by making notes, reviewing, and learning from the past. The market rhymes so you will more than likely see whatever you saw again. 


# Balance Sheet info
!> What a company owns owes and how much shareholders have invested. 

When looking at a balance sheet, the general idea is `A = L + E`. That is, `assets` a company owns = the `liabilities` owed + `equity`. Very simple formula for understanding the balance sheet at a high level. Let's take look at three broad categories that make up the measure the strength of a balance sheet: working capital, asset performance, and capitalization structure.

`Working capital` - or short term liquidity, is a measure of a company's financial strength. Formula current assets  - current liabilities = working capital. Negative working capital. suggest that a company will have trouble paying short-term debt.

`asset performance` - A company's ability to take operational resources, manage them, and produce profitable returns. 

`Capitalization Structure`- The proportion of debt and equity in the capital configuration configuration of a company. 


`Non-Current Assets` - assets that are not turned into cash easily. 

# SELL-OF 11/18/2020

A personal reminder that I need to realize that I cannot own them all. There are stocks that I purchased like `$AMWL` that I had no business purchasing. Jumping the gun on a new IPO is what bit me the hardest recently. 3 of the 5 stocks that I sold were recent IPO's that I had little business owning. All of these companies were 

`$BLFS` - Bio Life sciences is actually an ok company that specializes in cryo tech or biopreservation for cells. Think about your Crisper gene editing or Invitae. This company is providing the "pics and shovels" to help get the job done. 

`$GDRX` - Chasing in the healthcare space is a theme here. This company sounded REALLY good on paper and did see good responses from respectable investors. However, why would I invest just because some random investor gave the approval? Why? because I'm blind and I enjoy chasing in the dark. Once `$AMZN` announced they will be getting in the pill subscription bussiness it was a wrap. GDRX dropped 15% on the news and has not stopped falling. I'm not holding/waiting for this stock to rebound. Sold for a loss and moved some money into `$NET`

`$AMWL` - This was a tele health play that I did ZERO research on and purchased the first day it IPO'ed. I got a quick double but held on to it. Should've sold out because I had no business holding this with zero research or any remote evidence of it being a good company. I was chasing.

`$RKT` - housing market should be a profitable place. Why not buy this company without doing any research!? Sure, orders coming up. Another chase that did not pan out. 

`$ATVI` - I went into this investing journey very bullish on the e-sports industry without really knowing how to define the industry. I'm starting to better understand that the industry is a cash cow but its so fragmented it will be hard to by the entire cow. I had to sell $ATVI on the weak performance after earnings. Will I regret it? maybe, but for right now i'm looking for growth so companies with a lower stock market will be the target for my funds.

After selling the above mentioned stocks I put half the cash on the sidelines and added to a few existing positions. I'm currently looking to buy back into BLFS... Why, this may sound crazy buy my girlfriend has been right more than I have on her investing decisions and she is not an investor nor invested!!!. She told me to buy `$TSLA`, `$PINS`, and bio-tech... I did not listen to her TSLA argument but I did take action on PINS but it was a bit late. either way, she is 3 for 3. I'm going to place a buy order of `$BLFS` tomorrow morning and never look back. 

# What I'm looking for
* companies with high `gross margins`! The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company retains on each dollar of sales. 
* Year over year growth. If the company is not growing it better have a good restructuring excuse. I'm looking for companies that showing growth year after year!

# November Portfolio Update

<h3>Top holdings</h3> 

`$PINS` 

`$SE`

`$ROKU` 

`$ETSY` 

`$CRWD` 

`$MGNI` 

`$NET`

`$HUBS` 

`$DOCU`

`$AMD`

November was a great month for my holdings. My portfolio is up 5% for the month and 40% for the year. I had to move some holdings around to make room for a few stocks that I had a higher conviction towards. I'm also looking to reduce the number of stocks that I currently hold. As of right now I have a position in 45 companies and I'm looking to reduce that to 35.  

* I sold `$ADYEY` to free up some cash to buy back a position in `$BLFS`.   
* SOLD `$DLR` and `$CONE` to start a new position in `$IIPR`. - 3bln market cap with lost of room to run. the gross margins are in the 70+ percentage so there is little overhead that this company needs to provide. Not to mention the lease agreements are for years, not months. Believe the growing of cannabis will be a lucrative business in the next 3-5yrs. 
* Sold `$FSLY` and `$NTDOY` and started a position in `$LSPD` - my thoughts on e-sports were a bit premature as these gaming companies are not the ones making most of the money. its really one or two publishers that are capitalizing on this craze. I'm pretty much out of the e-sports play and using `$ARKW` as my barometer. 
* Trimmed some `$MSFT` to add to my winners who were already winning `$NVCR` `$TDOC` `$NET`. - I'm creating bigger positions so when they double the double will be bigger than a few hundred dollars. By adding to the mention 3 names I believe they will be future leaders within their industry. 

Since I've started becoming a more serious investor in June of 2020 I've seen my performance improve month after month. A few things I'm noticing that I feel like I need to get under control is the number of positions I have open. 45 is too much and I need to focus on my winners. It's why I picked them and its why they are still in my portfolio.

<h3>Which stocks are on the chopping block? and Why?</h3>
</center>

* `$CRM` - I have Salesforce on the chopping block because of the market cap being at 225bln. For this company to 10x it will probaly take another 10 years. Which isnt bad but it is also not ideal for me. However, I'm a longterm investor and having a company like Salesforce in my portfolio will build strength during market downturns. 

* `$FUTU` - FUTU is a chinese company that is similar to robinhood but located in china. This is the only Chinese stock I own and I purchased this stock because I saw it was mentioned on twitter by a few traders, heard it on a podcast, and I also like the growth story that was tied to it. But at the end of the day I do not know exactly what the company is doing or how they are making money. I've done little to zero due dilligance on the company and if this is a "dud" I can only blame myself. 

* `$RDFN` & `$EXIP` - Real estate stocks. I have too many and I only need one more within my portfolio... maybe. However, i'm torwn between these two companies because of the profile and coverage they are receiving. `$EXPI` - is a international compnay that is in a growth stage that is growing at the same pace, if not faster than `$RDFN`. However, I own Zillow already and why do I need THREE stocks that are all working in the same space!??? 2 have to go and its not Zillow. I'm going to wait 4 qtrs to see who has performed the best before making a final decision. The race between these two is very close and I'm a bit torn as to which company has the best leadership + opportunity... FWIW i'm leaning towards dropping redfin and picking up international holdings. 

* `$DLR` - This is a solid company to have in your portfolio and the growth of this company over 5 years is about the same as `$SPY`. This is not something that I would consider good or bad but I'd say neutral. If I wanted to perform the same as the `$SPY` that is what I would buy. However, I'm looking for growth so I'm going to trade out my `$DLR` shares for `$IIPR`. The stock just broke out of a 2019 resistance and is looking healthy. 3bln dollar company with a lot of room to run in the comming years. Looking to hold for the next 3 years and will compare with the `$SPY` once again. 

* `$PTON` - I dont get the business but I own the stock. That is all I have to say. Will sell when I see an opportunity come around or I'm looking to add to an existing position. 

I'll be down to 40 positions If I sell all of the above, which I hope to do in the coming months as my convictions begin to fade. IF I do start a new position in a company I will say that one of these will need to go. I believe having 35 positions would be ideal for me as an investor at the moment. 5-7 positions that have moved into the larger 100bln+ market cap. while the other 25 are under the 100bln trying to make their way up the ranks.
