# <center>Purpose of EngineerTree5 [here]</center>

I created EngineerTree5 as a way to tinker with code and develop automated solutions for whatever comes to mind. as of right now the core of the solutions have been around using the [tweepy](https://engineertree5.github.io/tree5_treehouse/#/tweepy) api for twiter. So far I created a voicemail bot to automatically respond when I go on a twitter vacation, scraped Spotify for songs that you tweet to the bot, and created a daily stock market data readout. Cool shit if I say so myself. This is just a site to take notes, learn in public, and document the process.
