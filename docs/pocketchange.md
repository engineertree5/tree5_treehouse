Earlier in the week I was procrastinating and found myself on finviz.com looking for stock opportunities. When on finviz.com I usually start a filter that targets high revenue growth QoQ and YoY. However, I've been researching more companies in the healthcare space as of late so I started with that. Ok, Healthcare companies and... profit! I'm trying to find companies in the healthcare space that are turning a profit. Surprise! There are not many companies in the healthcare space doing this, making a profit. There are even fewer small-cap healthcare companies turning a profit, the type of companies I like to invest in (10x potential). With the help of finviz I spotted this small-cap that was turning a profit, `$CARA`. Now to understand what the company is doing to make a profit.

First stop, investor presentation. The company summary: Cara therapeutics focuses on developing and commercializing chemical entities with a primary focus on `pruritus` and pain by  targeting kappa opioid receptors.

Their number one product right now is the `KORSUVA` injection which is currently under NDA Review and slated to be cleared in the 2nd half of 2021 (no date given). `KORSUVA` is non-addictive does away with all the side-effects of opioids and may replace the industry standard. Because this drug is currently under NDA review and is slated to be commercialized by 2022, `$CARA` looks like it is ready to take off. Not only that there are 3 other legs (oral drugs) in the development pipeline.

This `$CARA` reminds me of a similar company I'm currently invested in, `$ORMP`, which is treating a similar problem within the diabetes space. I'm unfamiliar with the true TAM of the diabetic market but I know it is one of the largest contributors to healthcare costs.

`$CARA` looks like it is ready for takeoff. However, my conviction in this company is low. One reason is that becoming a successful powerhouse in the healthcare space is no easy feat and I'm not sure if `$CARA` has what it takes to become that pharma powerhouse. I have a small starter position that I plan on holding for the next three years to track the progress of the KORSUVA rollout along with the oral KORSUVA development.
