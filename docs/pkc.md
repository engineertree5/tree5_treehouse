# PKC

Sooooo PKC is the shit! You get TWO EXTREMELY LONG prime numbers - these are going to be your private keys - and combine them. Those combined prime numbers will be your public key. So, now you can assign that prime number to a txt message. Then send it out into the wild, across the internet, into your receivers hands safely. Ah! But keep in mind that in order to read (decrypt) the txt message you need th other large prime number to read it. If another person try’s to read your message they will need the other large prime number (private key) to decrypt the message.... fuckin’ PKC. Cool shit
