# 100 Days Of Code

 For my 100 days of code the aim is to be a better teacher, investor, and programmer. I'm designing the plan as I draw it, so my agenda will be shared on a day by day basis. 

## Day 1 - Birth of pyetf
For Day 1 of 100 we will be working with the yfinance module which is used to pull stock market information from yahoo. I will be going at MY own pace so if you need more information or get stuck just reach out. Most of this information/code is for myself and anyone willing to read/use it. 

> Go visit this [LINK](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to get started with yfinance module.


So we will be putting all of our code into a class so we can easily add new code to what we do within the 100 days. Think of a class as a collection of commands. By just looking at the methods within the class we are only performing verbs - GET SET. 

### Quick Summary
By default, A user will need to pass in the stock(s) they are looking to get information on and the number of trading days. As of day 1 we are only pulling basic fundamental data. As we look to improve the code more functions will be added as we reach 100 days.
